gw-xor of lightweight MDS matrix

In this folder, there are a total of 4 codes.

Algorithms1.cpp - the main program is to find potential paths .
This program requires compilation it with C++11 or newer.
An  command will be:
        g++ Algorithms1.cpp 
 and then
        ./a.out
The potential paths can be obtained.


Algorithms2.cpp - the main program is to find The MDS matrices with the 8n+3 xor gate.
This program requires compilation it with C++11 or newer.
An  command will be:
        g++ Algorithms2.cpp 
 and then
        ./a.out
The MDS matrices with the 8n+3 xor gate can be obtained.

Algorithms3_1_path4.cpp - the main program is to find potential paths with the depth less 4 .
This program requires compilation it with C++11 or newer.
An  command will be:
        g++ Algorithms3_1_path4.cpp 
 and then
        ./a.out
The potential paths can be obtained.


Algorithms3_2_path4.cpp - the main program is to find The MDS matrices with the 8n+5 xor gate and the depth less 4 .
This program requires compilation it with C++11 or newer.
An  command will be:
        g++ Algorithms3_2_path4.cpp 
 and then
        ./a.out
The MDS with the 8n+5 xor gate can be obtained.


above codes also can be run by using visual studio 2017.
