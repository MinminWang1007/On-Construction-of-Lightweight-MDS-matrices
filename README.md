In this folder, there are a total of 4 codes.

Algorithms1.cpp - the main program is to find potential paths.
This program requires compilation it with C++11 or newer.
A  command will be:
        g++ Algorithms1.cpp 
 and then
        ./a.out.
The potential paths can be obtained.


Algorithms2.cpp - the main program is to find  the MDS matrices with  8n+3 xor gates.
This program requires compilation it with C++11 or newer.
A  command will be:
        g++ Algorithms2.cpp 
 and then
        ./a.out.
The MDS matrices with  8n+3 xor gates can be obtained.

Algorithms3_1_path4.cpp - the main program is to find potential paths with the depth less 4 .
This program requires compilation it with C++11 or newer.
A  command will be:
        g++ Algorithms3_1_path4.cpp 
 and then
        ./a.out.
The potential paths of depth less 4  can be obtained.


Algorithms3_2_path4.cpp - the main program is to find  the MDS matrices with  8n+5 xor gates and the depth less 4 .
This program requires compilation it with C++11 or newer.
A  command will be:
        g++ Algorithms3_2_path4.cpp 
 and then
        ./a.out.
The MDS matrices with 8n+5 xor gates and the depth less 4 can be obtained.


Above codes also can be run by using visual studio 2017.
